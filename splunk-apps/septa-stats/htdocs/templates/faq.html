<h2>Is the Source Code Available?</h2>

You bet it is!  It can be found on GitHub at:

<h2>Why does the 7 Day System Lateness Graph Start At The Current Hour?</h2>

Good question!  I had originally tried to "solve" the problem by doing custom 
sorting by hour in Javascript, but a new problem emerged: how the graph looked
for the rest of the day.  If the time was say, 6 PM, the current day's lateness
would say the same for the next 5 hours.  I thought of reducing the lateness
to zero for the rest of that, but that's also not an optimal solution as it
make it looks like the trains will be at zero lateness for the rest of the evening.

I'm open for other suggestions on how to make the grpah look better.


<h2>Why do some of the train graphs show the wrong station order, or even fail to show a train?</h2>

This is due partly due to some train lines overlapping.
<br/>
<br/>

For example, train 553 is:
<ul>
<li>Glenside Inbound</li>
<li>Lansdale/Doylestown Inbound</li>
<li>and Paoli/Thorndale Outbound</li>
</ul>

Only by looking at an actual map can you tell that the Glenside Inbound is a subset
of the Lansdale/Doyletown Inbound.  This situation (and many others) aren't clearly disclosed in the train data.
<br/>
<br/>

Now I know what you're thinking, let's just ignore stations like Glenside that are in the "middle"
of other lines.  Problem is, sometimes Glenside <em>is</em> the endpoint.  Train 3425
is a good example of this: it starts as a West Trenton Inbound and ends at the airport.  But
<em>some days</em> it starts as a Glenside inbound.  
<br/>
<br/>

At least, that's what I got from
parsing train numbers out of the schedules listed at <a href="http://www4.septa.org/schedules/rail/index.html"
	>http://www4.septa.org/schedules/rail/index.html</a>.  Is it possible that the schedules contain
outdated info?  Yes, absolutely.
<br/>
<br/>

While I can continue to try to deal with weird edge cases, what we ultimately need is
better/more explicit data coming from SEPTA's API so that better graphs can be made. :-)


<h2>Can I get a dump of all of the train data from this website?</h2>

Sure!  I have many months of train data, as I have been running this website in "stealth mode" for quite
some time now.  Please <a href="/about">contact me</a> if you'd like, and I'll get you as much
of the data as you like!
