<h1>About SEPTA Stats</h1>

<h2>What is this website? Who built it?</h2>

I hope the "<em>what</em>" part is pretty self-explanatory.  This website holds up to 
the minute statistics on all Regional Rail trains that SEPTA is running.  This is
accomplished through a <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk instance</a> downloading data
<a href="http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/">from SEPTA's API</a>, 
storing the data, and serving up the reports.  The front end consists
of <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">Slim PHP</a> for request routing, 
<a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for the UI, 
and <a href="http://www.canvasjs.com/">CanvasJS</a> for the graphing.
<br/>
<br/>

As for the "<em>who</em>", my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmuth">Douglas Muth</a>.
I am a software egnineer who lives in Ardmore and take Regional Rail into Center City for work.
<br/>

How to get in touch with me? Email works pretty well: <b>doug.muth AT gmail DOT com</b> and <b>dmuth AT dmuth DOT org</b> both work.
You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/dmuth">Twitter</a>

<h2>Why did you build it?</h2>

One particular week, I noticed that the train I took home wasn't just late every day, but
as I would refresh <a href="http://app.septa.org/nta/txt/result.php?loc_a=Suburban+Station&loc_z=Ardmore&submit=Submit"
	>the status page</a>, it kept getting later and later.  As someone who runs a Splunk cluster
professionally, I thought it would be nice if I could get a graph that shows how late that train
is over time, and perhaps see if there is a bottleneck somewhere in SEPTA's system.  That prompted
me to build the MVP entirely in Splunk.  That leads us to...


<h2>What do you want to do with it?</h2>

First, I wanted to provide this as a public transit to the other riders of SEPTA Regional Rail.
I hope they find the train reports and station reports as useful as I did.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, I was hoping to demo this website to SEPTA's Senior Leadership Team and show them some of the
things that can be done with Splunk and data analytics.  It wouldn't be too difficult to 
expand on what's here to search for trains that are chronically late (candidates for having their schedule changed?)
or to find "ripple effects" where one train being late impacts multiple other trains.
<br/>
<br/>
I am also toying with the idea of tracking weather conditions (rainfall, temperate, and wind)
integrating them with some of the train lateness graphs to look for correlations.  This could be
used to predict the overall lateness of trains and aid with future planning efforts.


<h2>How YOU can help!</h2>

I'll be blunt--I'm decent at back-end systems engineering, but when it comes to front-end and UI/UX... 
I'm a little out of my league there.  If you're a designer, UX specialist, or have other front-end
experience, please drop me a line.  I'd love some guidance on the front end and layout of this
site from someone who knows these things better than I. :-)
