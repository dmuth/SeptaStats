<h2>Why does the 7 Day System Lateness Graph Start At The Current Hour?</h2>

Good question!  I had originally tried to "solve" the problem by doing custom 
sorting by hour in Javascript, but a new problem emerged: how the graph looked
for the rest of the day.  If the time was say, 6 PM, the current day's lateness
would say the same for the next 5 hours.  I thought of reducing the lateness
to zero for the rest of that, but that's also not an optimal solution as it
make it looks like the trains will be at zero lateness for the rest of the evening.
<br/>

I'm open for other suggestions on how to make the grpah look better.
